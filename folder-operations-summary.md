# Folder Operations Summary

## Current Folder Operations (Based on Code Analysis)

### 1. **Creating Folders**
- **Drag one shortcut onto another**: Creates a new folder containing both shortcuts
- **Implementation**: `createFolderFromShortcuts()` method in shortcuts.js

### 2. **Adding Items to Folders**
- **Drag shortcut onto folder icon**: Adds the shortcut to the folder
- **Drop zone**: Central 50% of the folder icon (25%-75% horizontally)
- **Implementation**: Handled by MouseDragManager with `currentDropMode = 'folder'`

### 3. **Removing Items from Folders**
- **Drag out of folder modal**: Items can be dragged from the folder modal to the dark background area
- **Result**: Item is moved out of the folder and placed at the end of the main grid
- **Implementation**: `setupModalDragOut()` in newtab.js and modal-drag-fix.js

### 4. **Reordering Items Within Folders**
- **Status**: NOW ENABLED with the new FolderMouseDragManager implementation
- **Method**: Click and drag items within the folder modal to reorder them
- **Implementation**: FolderMouseDragManager class extends MouseDragManager

### 5. **Folder Name Editing**
- **Previous behavior**: Auto-focused when opening modal or using edit menu
- **New behavior**: Click on the folder title to enter edit mode
- **Implementation**: Modified in newtab.js to remove auto-focus

### 6. **Opening Folders**
- **Click on folder**: Opens the folder modal showing all contained shortcuts
- **Implementation**: `openFolderModal()` function

### 7. **Deleting Folders**
- **Right-click > Delete**: Deletes the folder
- **Result**: All items inside the folder are moved to the main grid
- **Implementation**: `delete()` method checks if item is folder and moves contents out
